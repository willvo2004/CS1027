-----------------------------------------------



EXERCISE 1

1. Which methods in the DLQueue class are taking in a parameter of the generic type T?

Only enqueue.

2. Which methods in the DLQueue class have a return type of the generic type T?

Enqueue, and first

3. Suppose you didn't have an instance variable storing the current number of elements in the queue. How could you determine the number of elements for the size() method if such an instance variable was not available?

since rear = count - 1, we can keep track of the number of elements in the queue with rear + 1

EXERCISE 2

4. Consider the possibility of using an Array Queue or a Circular Array Queue instead of the Doubly Linked Queue being used in this simulation. Would the simulation's results be impacted by switching to a different Queue implementation?

No, the results of the simulation would not change as both implementations use the first in first out principle.

5. Which line(s) of code in Snail.java and/or SnailRace.java would you have to modify if you were going to use a different queue implementation?

I would change the constructor of Snail.java.
