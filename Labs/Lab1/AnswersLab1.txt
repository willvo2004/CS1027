2. Why do we need to use the "this" keyword? What happens if we don't use it?

The "this" keyword removes ambiguity from instance variables and method parameters.
If there is no ambiguity, we may omit this.
However, if for example, an instance variable and a parameter share the same name, then ommiting "this" will
result in unwanted results (or something).

4. Which class contains the equals() method being called here? Is it calling itself?

The equals() method being called comes from the String class.
It is not calling itself. In this case, eqauls() is a built-in java method for String objects.
