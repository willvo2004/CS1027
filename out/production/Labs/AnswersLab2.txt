Answers for Lab 2
-----------------------------------------------



EXERCISE 1

1. Should instance variable interestRate be declared as static? Explain.

It should not be declared as static because We should have that every instance of the class SavingsAccount
should have its own unique interest rate.

2. Write the output from the test harness for class SavingsAccount. 

SavingsAccount: Balance $115.0, interest rate 0.15

EXERCISE 2

3. Which method(s) of the class CheckingAccount demonstrate overriding? Which methods demonstrate overloading?
Overriding: Deposit, withdraw and toString. There are no overloaded methods

4. Is bacc0 = chacc1 legal? Why?
Legal:
This is allowed in Java because a child class object is also an instance of its parent class due to inheritance

5. Is chacc1 = bacc1 legal? Why?
Illegal:
This is because the parent class does not have information about the child class.
A parent class object does not have access to the attributes and behaviors specific to the child class.

6. On which variables bacc1, chacc1, sacc1 was the invocation to method
deductFees() valid? Explain.
Is valid on chacc1 because it is an instance of CheckingAccount, which is where the method is defined

7. Which compilation error(s) could be fixed through casting? Which one(s)
could not be fixed? Why?
Setting variable to a bank account object would fix the issue. However, setting variable to a savings account object would not fix the error.
This is because savings account is a child class of bank account, and so any method defined in checking account (also a child of bank account)
would not be able to be called on an object of a different child class.

8. Why did the program crash? What kind of exception was thrown?
After commenting out the compilation errors, the program was able to compile and run and no exception was thrown.
I think in some cases a ClassCastException exception would be thrown at run rime.

9. What was the runtime error obtained when changing super.deposit(amount)
to deposit(amount) in class CheckingAccount.java? 
Exception thrown:
StackOverFlowError
This error occured because we ommited the 'super' prefix in our deposit method in CheckingAccount.
What results is the method enters a recursive loop of its self, and without a base case the program
will run until it crashes or 'overflows'.


EXERCISE 3

10. Why does the compiler issue an error message when invoking newAcc.getTransactionCount()? Why does the compiler issue an error message when invoking newAcc.getInterestRate()?
The reason newAcc.getTransactionCount() and newAcc.getInterestRate() throw compilation errors is because newAcc is declared as a reference of type BankAccount.

11. Can you tell whether in the statement String accountInfo = newAcc.toString(); the
method toString() being invoked is from the class CheckingAccount or from the class
SavingsAccount? Explain your answer.
